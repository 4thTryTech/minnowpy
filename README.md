# minnowpy
A library to mimic portions of WPILIB for teaching FRC robotics programming basics using MicroPython

The goal for MinnowPy is to be able to use cheap micropython control boards with specific, common tasks to allow an FRC team to use these cheap and accessible systems to teach both general programming and FRC specific programming tasks in the off season with minimal hardware and software requirements.  For these common tasks, the code will look and feel like code written using RobotPy WPILib.  

MinnowPy is not intended to be used on competition robots, nor is it intended as a general purpose robotics framework, though it should work fine if the tasks happen to allign with the teaching tasks this project is intended for.

# Why MinnowPy?
"Minnow Is NNOt WPIlib"

In addition to the recusive acronym, a minnow is small and fast, and kids of all ages like to try to catch them - just like this library should be.
